This is a copy of my projects from the free Elements of Computer Systems course at http://diycomputerscience.com/courses/course/the-elements-of-computing-systems .

If you haven't done the course, I definitely recommend it.  Reading through the files here may spoil some of the course for you, though, and you'll get less from it.
